# :construction: Frameworks for Building Agents

## [Agents](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents)

**Agents** is an open-source library/framework for building autonomous language agents.

<details>

### Description
-   **Long-short Term Memory**: Language agents in the library are equipped with both long-term memory implemented via VectorDB + Semantic Search and short-term memory (working memory) maintained and updated by an LLM.
-   **Tool Usage**: Language agents in the library can use any external tools via  [function-calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)  and developers can add customized tools/APIs  [here](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents/blob/master/src/agents/Component/ToolComponent.py).
-   **Web Navigation**: Language agents in the library can use search engines to navigate the web and get useful information.
-   **Multi-agent Communication**: In addition to single language agents, the library supports building multi-agent systems in which language agents can communicate with other language agents and the environment. Different from most existing frameworks for multi-agent systems that use pre-defined rules to control the order for agents' action,  **Agents**  includes a  _controller_  function that dynamically decides which agent will perform the next action using an LLM by considering the previous actions, the environment, and the target of the current states. This makes multi-agent communication more flexible.
-   **Human-Agent interaction**: In addition to letting language agents communicate with each other in an environment, our framework seamlessly supports human users to play the role of the agent by himself/herself and input his/her own actions, and interact with other language agents in the environment.
-   **Symbolic Control**: Different from existing frameworks for language agents that only use a simple task description to control the entire multi-agent system over the whole task completion process,  **Agents**  allows users to use an  **SOP (Standard Operation Process)**  that defines subgoals/subtasks for the overall task to customize fine-grained workflows for the language agents.

## [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
AutoGen is a framework by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat/) that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve task


<details>

### Description
-  AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation
-  They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools
-  AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages:
	- it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs
  	- it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents
     	- it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats
